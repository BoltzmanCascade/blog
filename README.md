## Welcome ##

Thanks for visiting my repo, it's kind of a work in progress... 

i.e. perpetually a work in progress...

I am a full stack software engineer living and working in Seattle, WA.  I am passionate about highly performant apps, and love working in audio, video, and crypto applications. 

I work on iOS, Android, and IoT applications and the cloud based services they consume.

## Primary Programming Languages ##

Swift 

> I have worked with Swift since it's was first publicly available.  I am also familiar with the swift compiler, package manager, and lldb implementation at a source code level. 

Objective-C

>I began working with Objective-C before the release of iOS, and as a result I have been working with iOS since it's first release. I published a number of early articles on how to do TDD with iOS/X-Code, how to consume services, and general coding guidelines for companies starting with Objective-C.



C/C++ 

>I have worked with C and C++ throughout my career. 
Early on I worked with high-capacity distributed and computational systems utilizing C++ and big metal assembly languages like PA-RISC, later with dynamically discoverable late bound distributed services in the same fashion.  Now though, most of my C++ work is when working with LLDB/LLVM/Clang extensions.

Go

>I am relatively new to Go, I have been working with it for just about two years now.  I am very familiar with and I am a big fan of the go/docker pairing for quickly standing up services for mobile clients to consume.
I have workd with both Redis and Dynamo as persistence stores, I am familiar with the proper use of channels, debugging using dlv, and TDD using a number of test frameworks.

Python

>I actually became more proficient at Python by teaching it to my kids, then when I discovered what an be done with LLDB and Python, I was hooked.  Now I use it as my goto scripting language for most things unless there is a specific reason not to.
